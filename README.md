# Resume Portfolio Website 
## Final project for CS50x Introduction to Computer Science
## https://jillg387.github.io/

### Description:

#### For my final project, I wanted to create a more engaging way to showcase my skills. Instead of a traditional resume, I built an online portfolio website that blends design and functionality. I used Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make a website that looks great and is easy to use. As visitors scroll down, my content gradually appears, creating a more dynamic experience.

#### I chose a deep purple color scheme that I find both professional and visually appealing. I also used the AOS animation library to make the content appear smoothly.

#### My headshot is artfully enhanced with generative AI technology from Adobe's Creative Suite. The background is an AI-generated image.

#### Navigation is simple and intuitive. I used Bootstrap's framework and visually appealing icons.

#### To maintain focus, I've opted to link my comprehensive portfolio of work externally. This way, people can see my curent work and learn more about me.  

#### I'm particularly proud of the technical skills I developed during this project. I learned a lot about using Bootstrap, JavaScript, and creating a positive user experience.

#### I'm grateful for the knowledge and confidence gained through this course. This website showcases my passion for creating and coding my own work, design, and storytelling. It's more than a resume; it's a digital portal into my professional world, crafted to both engage, and inform.

#### UPDATE: I am currently using this site as a website portfolio so it's content will gradutally evolve.
